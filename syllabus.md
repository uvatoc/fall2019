_To study calculus it is essential that you are able to breathe. Without that ability you will soon die, and be unable to continue.
Beyond that, you will need some familiarity with two notions: the notion of a number, and that of a function._
Daniel Kleitman, [_Calculus for Beginners_](http://www-math.mit.edu/~djk/calculus_beginners/chapter00/section01.html)
